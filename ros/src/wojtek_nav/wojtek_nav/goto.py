"""Drive to a setpoint, straight, with the costmap as the safety veto.

Pure logic, no ROS: a `GotoController` is stepped with the robot's planar
pose, the current goal and a probe into the costmap, and answers with a
velocity command and a status word. The ROS node (goto_node.py) is a thin
shell around it, so the behaviour is testable on a desk.

The contract this implements (decided with the owner, 2026-09-25): the VLM
hands over the NEXT setpoint, a point in the odom frame ~1 m ahead, about
once a second; the robot walks straight at it. No local planner: the
strategy -- which way round the crate -- is the VLM's, from the picture.
What the robot keeps for itself is the veto: the costmap remembers what
the camera no longer sees, and if the footprint ahead would meet an
obstacle the robot stops and says so, until a new setpoint or a cleared
map lets it move. Strategy up there, reflexes down here.

Motion is non-holonomic on purpose even though the policy can strafe: the
camera looks where the body points, and a robot that walks sideways walks
blind. So: turn towards the setpoint first (in place when the bearing is
large), then walk, steering with a proportional yaw command.

Timing. A setpoint expires `goal_timeout` seconds after it arrived: the
VLM must keep talking to keep Wojtek walking, the same dead-man
text_commander has. Reaching the setpoint also stops the robot; there is
no "and then what" -- the next setpoint is the VLM's answer to the next
picture.
