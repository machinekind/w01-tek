"""A pixel in the camera picture becomes a setpoint for goto: the maths.

The VLM answers a picture with WHERE (a pixel on the thing to walk to) and
nothing else. Everything metric happens here, on the robot, from the depth
image that was taken with that picture:

    pixel (colour image) --viewing ray--> pixel (depth image) --median--> z
    --pinhole--> point in the depth optical frame --tf2 @ picture stamp-->
    point in odom --standoff--> the setpoint goto drives to

Pure logic, no ROS: the node (pixel_goal_node.py) feeds it images,
intrinsics and stamps; the tests feed it numbers. Measured in the
simulator (2026-09-25): 2 mm between this chain and the truth, in the
robot's own frame -- the picture's depth is the whole answer, as long as
it is the depth of THAT picture.
